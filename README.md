## Simple Scavenger Hunt
This repo was created by Nathan R. for the Phys Dept Scavenger Hunt.
It is currently formatted for the 2021 set up, relaxing the PPE
recommendations and safety first clue from 2020. When adapting for 
future years remember that the footer has a note about the bonfire,
which may or may not apply to your year.
