      Welcome to the 2020 UIUC Scavenger Hunt! This activity is intended to familarize you with some
      important places on campus, and introduce you to some of your peers in our department. At all times
      we ask that you follow social distancing <a href="https://drs.illinois.edu/Page/COVID19CampusSafety">guidelines</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      <ol>
        <li>
          PPE should be worn at all times, and physical interactions (e.g. sharing phones) should be kept to a minimum.
        </li>
        <li>
          At no point will we ask you to enter a building, or break campus distancing guidelines in any way. If you or
          someone in your group has concerns about breaking social distancing, please let us know as soon as you can and
          we will change or accomodate to the best of our abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the start, you will have [insert time allotted here] to complete all of the prompts to the best of your
          ability. It's ok if you don't finish all of the prompts, quality over quantity (there are some sweet bonuses that
          can help compensate for not completing all of the challenges).
        </li>
        <li>
          At least one of your group members should log in officially to the scavenger hunt platform. Information will be
          provided at the start point to bring you to the required platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the duration of the competition there will be someone at the start point, so if you have any questions or
          finish early head back there.
        </li>
        <li>
          The start and end points will be the same. Meet at [start time - 15 minutes] near [insert start location].
        </li>
        <li>
          Every prompt will require a real-time submission of a photo or video, so make sure to have the cameras rolling
          where necessary. Your submissions will be reviewed to tabulate points, and bonus points, at the end of the
          competition.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are five prompts that lead you to a fellow Physics student (who will have a nametag or some indication that
          they're in physics), each prompt that does so will have a note at the beginning saying "Peer Involved." These five
          are required to win. Before being able to complete the prompt, you must meet with them. They have some information
          about the place you'll find yourself, its relevance to Physics at UIUC, and how you can earn the points for their
          prompt. If you do not meet with them, you will not receive the points for their prompt. We will be able to tell by
          your submission.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Points</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 15px;">The amount of points each prompt is worth will be listed alongside the prompt itself, as well as any bonus points you
    may be able to aquire for it.</p>

    <h2>Prizes</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 15px;">Prizes will be awarded at the end for all participants, and for the teams with the top three scores.</p>
