    Clue: A really important skill to have in science is communication, and something that always helps communication is a cool demonstration.<br>

    There are several such demonstrations around Loomis Lab that inspire EOH demonstrations. You'll need to come up with one on your own (feel free to take inspiration from any you may know of inside Loomis). For this mission you need to film one of your teammates giving an overly confident mis-explanation of what the demonstration proves.<br>
