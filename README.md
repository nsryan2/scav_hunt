## Phys Welcome Week Scavenger Hunt
This repo was created by Nathan R. for the Phys Dept Scavenger Hunt.
It is currently formatted for the 2021 set up, relaxing the PPE
recommendations and safety first clue from 2020. When adapting for 
future years remember that the footer has a note about the bonfire,
which may or may not apply to your year.

## Adapting
This repo is equipped with jekyll capabilities, so you can fork and 
clone this repo like any other and when you're ready to see the
changes locally you can put:
`jekyll serve`
into the command line and it should pop right up.
If it doesn't, check the gemfile and make sure everything is 
installed.
