    Clue: UIUC has four prominent quads, and something to keep in mind when choosing 
    classes is how much time it takes to get from one place to another. With this in mind, 
    we want you to pick a quad, select a building that is directly on that quad, and 
    take a picture of your entire team directly in front of the sign (so we can see the name) for that building.
    <br><br> 
    200 Bonus points for the building (not on the main quad) that is the furthest away 
    from the starting location.

    Clue: *Peer Involved*<br>
    Are you jones-ing for some course advice, but don't know where to go?<br>
    <br>
    How about a lecture? Nuclear arms or learning with some fans of E.A. Poe<br>
    <br>
    This place has everything and more,<br>
    <br>
    a teathered ball, Jacob's ladder, and four floors.<br>

    Stop on by, don't be shy, this place is now your home.

    Clue: *Peer Involved*<br>
    There are many places on campus to love and hate, and I'm no exception.<br>
    <br>
    I'm the largest of my kind for this nation,<br>
    <br>
    but that doesn't mean you'll find any fairy tale endings.<br>
    <br>
    I have a friend named Bob who never leaves,<br>
    <br>
    and more manuscripts on railroads that I know what to do with.<br>
    <br>
    Come to me for many things, but poetry isn't one.<br>
    <br>
    I've got many books, but this poem now is done.

    Clue: *Peer Involved*<br>
    I'm not a horror shop, I hold a very different kind of scare.<br>
    <br>
    Many rooms line my halls, and a library all to myself, something, with other departments, I do not share.<br>
    <br>
    I've been many things to U of I, and I'll likely be your last stop, even if it's on a dare.<br>
    <br>
    Tick Tock, I'm not always a clock, but some times I do declare.

    I'm not easy to find, without a map your chances aren't so good.<br>
    <br>
    It'll be worth it for the next four years, so seek me out my curry if you would.<br>
    <br>
    I'm Green to go, wouldn't you know with so many options I'm the place to go.<br>
    <br>
    Up some steps, in the shadows you'll find me and my pho.

    Clue: *Peer Involved*<br>
    I see further than any human on campus, even if you stand atop the pineapple<br>
    <br>
    On the registers of historic places, in 1986 I made it to national.<br>
    <br>
    My many lenses are quite a site,<br>
    <br>
    Although my exterior is a little old, many groups used to stop by night after night.
